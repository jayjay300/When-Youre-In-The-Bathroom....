# When-Youre-In-The-Bathroom....
A site I created experimenting with some JS sound libraries.
Based on a popular internet trend, where popular songs are taken and muffled, to simulate how it would sound if you were to leave the room
to go to the bathroom.

User clicks and picks a sound file from their computer, where it is then outputted muffled and distorted.
