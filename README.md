# When-Youre-In-The-Bathroom....


A site I created experimenting with some JS sound libraries.

Based on a popular internet trend, where popular songs are taken and muffled, 
to simulate how it would sound if you were at a party, and you left the room
to use the bathroom.

User clicks and picks a sound file from their computer, where it is then outputted muffled and distorted.
